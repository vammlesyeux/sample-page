    Unbeknownzt to us, we have been destined to program (oh well maybe code for now, or are they the same? suit yourself haha) on our junior year as a university student. Paano ba kasi to? murag <strong>"HELLO, GPT!"</strong> man ta padulong ani huhu

<h5> How unfortunate is it for us to do something we have very little knowledge? 
  but how fortunate is it also that we will get to learn this before proceeding to our senior years? 
</h5>

  <br>
  
    <font size="1">
<p> Sometimes we pressure ourselves and lurk in the corners of the <em>"I can't do this"</em> and eventually drown into the thousand feet deep of <em> "I am a failure"</em> thoughts, when in fact,  we can divert our focus and attention to the open fields of <em> "I can do this!". </em></p>
      <br>
<p> A little self motivation in the midst of uncertainty goes a long way. Meeting peer motivation miles further from the starting point of what we call "scratch" fuels our self drive and determination to reach the end of the tunnel.</p>
      <br>
<p> So girls and boys, this is only one big rock that we can push over at some point when we are together. Togetherness, self motivation, and determination are only the few factors that could drive and lead us to the end of the tunnel where light and success is waiting for us. </p>
